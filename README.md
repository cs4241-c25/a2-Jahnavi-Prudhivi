Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js
===


---
## Task Management
Name: Jahnavi Prudhivi
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and communication between the client and the server.

This project is a task management web application that allows users to create, edit and delete tasks. The tasks are stored in a table and the user can interact with the table to perform these actions.
It has one form for creating new asks and another for editing existing tasks. When the user selects "Edit" on a task, the task's details are populated into the edit form.
This allows the user to make changes and save them. And tasks can also be deleted directly from the task table. This also uses Google Font API for headings/headers.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: This is a single-page app that provides a form for users to submit their tasks. When the user submits the tasks, the server sends the updated data
- **Tech Achievement 2**: The functionality of Editing a task is modified when you create a task.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I tested the interface with Kasireddy, Vivek. I asked him to make a couple tasks that he'd like to do. The feedback he gave was:
  1. Kasireddy
  2. The problems were mostly things the lack of detail/rows. He suggested add onto: He thought the user could categorize the tasks by classes they can input so they can select which one. Second, it'd be helpful if the user could move around the tasks, so putting all the priorities HIGH at the top, or the recent deadlines on top.
  3. They said they liked that the edit dialog came up after selecting the "edit" instead of just editing it in the create task.
  4. I would add the problems that Vivek Kasireddy gave. I would also add a more organized color scheme and aesthetics and I would also want to add on a Planner tab that would include a calendar style look to it.
